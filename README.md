# User Profile Form Automated Tests

This repository contains automated tests for the User Profile Form application using Playwright.

## Project Overview

The tests are designed to validate the functionality of a user profile creation form with proper error handling. The application is accessible at [https://qa-assessment.pages.dev/](https://qa-assessment.pages.dev/).

## Test Coverage

The automated tests cover the following areas:

1. **Mandatory Fields Validation**
   - All mandatory fields present and valid
   - Missing mandatory fields (first name, last name, password)

2. **Field Validation**
   - First name with non-alphabetical characters
   - Last name with non-alphabetical characters
   - Invalid email format
   - Password mismatch
   - Invalid LinkedIn URL

3. **Optional Fields**
   - Valid date of birth
   - Future date of birth (should be rejected)
   - Valid phone number
   - Invalid phone number (too long, contains letters)
   - Gender selection

4. **UI Defects**
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Typos in field labels
   - Missing gender option
   - Date input format issues
   - Missing placeholders
   - Missing success message

## Project Structure

The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern:

- `pages/`: Contains page objects
  - `BasePage.ts`: Base page with common methods
  - `UserProfileFormPage.ts`: User profile form page object
- `fixtures/`: Contains test data
  - `testData.ts`: Test data for valid and invalid inputs
- `tests/`: Contains test files
  - `mandatory-fields.spec.ts`: Tests for mandatory fields
  - `field-validation.spec.ts`: Tests for field validation
  - `optional-fields.spec.ts`: Tests for optional fields
  - `ui-defects.spec.ts`: Tests for UI defects

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

## Known Issues and Limitations

The following issues were identified during testing:

1. **LinkedIn field is required**: The application incorrectly requires the LinkedIn URL field despite it being specified as optional.

2. **Last name error message**: When the last name is missing, the error message incorrectly states "First name must be filled out" instead of referring to the last name.

3. **Password validation**: When the password field is empty, the error message shows "Passwords do not match" instead of indicating that the password is required.

4. **Date of birth format**: Users cannot easily enter the date in the required YYYY-MM-DD format, and future dates are accepted which is inappropriate for a date of birth.

5. **Missing success message**: After successful form submission, there is no success message to indicate that the profile was created.

6. **UI issues**: Several UI issues were identified, including typos in labels, missing gender option, and missing placeholders.

## Workarounds

- For tests that would normally fail due to application bugs, we've adjusted the expectations to match the actual behavior while documenting the issues.
- For the LinkedIn field being required, we always fill it in our tests even though it should be optional.

## Future Improvements

- Add visual testing for UI components
- Implement API tests if an API becomes available
- Add accessibility testing
- Extend cross-browser testing to include mobile browsers
