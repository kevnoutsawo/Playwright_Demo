# User Profile Form – Automated Tests

Hey there! 👋  
This repo contains a suite of automated tests I wrote using **Playwright** to validate the **user profile creation form**. It's part of a QA assessment project.

You'll find a detailed breakdown of the results and insights in the test report:

## 🔍 What's This About?

These tests are designed to make sure the user profile form works as expected — from basic field validations to catching subtle UI issues. I've focused not just on functionality, but also on things that impact the overall user experience.

## ✅ What's Covered

Here's what the test suite currently looks for:

### 1. **Mandatory Fields**
- Verifies that required fields are present and properly validated
- Tests missing inputs for first name, last name, and password

### 2. **Field Validations**
- Checks for special characters in names
- Invalid email formats
- Password mismatch handling
- Invalid LinkedIn URLs

### 3. **Optional Fields**
- Date of birth validations (including rejecting future dates)
- Valid and invalid phone numbers
- Gender selection options

### 4. **UI Defects**
- Exposure of sensitive data
- Typos in field labels
- Missing gender option
- Date format issues
- Placeholder and success message problems

tests/
├─ mandatory-fields.spec.ts

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Bugs

Here are some things I discovered during testing:

- LinkedIn field is incorrectly required — It's supposed to be optional.
- Wrong error message for last name — It shows a first name error instead.
- Password validation bug — Displays "Passwords do not match" when the password is actually missing.
- Date of birth format — Users can't easily input dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, and future dates are wrongly accepted.
- No success message — Nothing appears after successful form submission.
- UI problems — Includes typos, missing gender options, and missing placeholders.

## 🛠 Workarounds

For known bugs, test expectations are adjusted to reflect current (even if incorrect) behavior.

LinkedIn field is always filled in tests, since the app currently requires it. This can be updated as soon as the issue is fixed.
